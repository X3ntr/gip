    <h2>IT-Autobiography</h2>
<p>Hi, my name is Sander Forrer also known as X3ntr. I'm a 18 year old from Belgium, currently studying informatics at Immaculata Instituut Oostmalle.  </p>
<p>I came in touch with computers and games at the age of 7. My mom used educational programs/games to teach me and my 3 brothers math and spelling,... 
Two years later, I saw my stephbrother play Age Of Empires. From that moment I started playing simple games on CD-ROM. What roused my interests were the possibilities.<br />
All those things you can't do in real life were made possible and although my mom had set a limit on the time I could play, I really started to like it. It was like living a second life.<br />
Turning 14 was a major milestone in my early gamer-life. Me and my twin brother got our first laptop to share for our birthday. I started to play multiplayer and was allowed to create a Facebook account.<br />
The years after I got more games, used the computer daily for school work and entertainment and got my own laptop.<br />
It was then I encountered the first problems with game compatibility and small software issues.<br />
This wakened my interest in how computers work and how software and games are put together. My teachers back then had often very little computer knowledge and whenever there occured a problem me or one of my brothers used to fix it.<br />
I gamed a lot with my best buddy and we explored the online communities, participated in forum discussions and suddenly I heard about "hacks" and "hackers".<br />
This immediately got my attention and I started reading articles, books about programming in c++ and even biographies for example Kevin Mitnick.<br />
I realized there are a lot of difficulties and obstructions on the road of becoming a hacker and one of the biggest is where do I start? That's when I decided to change school and attend Immaculata Instituut to prepare for University.   </p>
<p>Today I usually spend about 8 to 10 or even 12 hours a day behind my pc. The major amount of time I play games or watch gamestreams, YouTube and communicate with my friends online.<br />
The time left I spend figuring things out, making homework or keeping up with the latest games, hardware. I really feel like there has been an evolution.<br />
I started out with playing simple games, now I write very simple games myself. I assembled three pc's so far and set up my own virtual lab.<br />
I crashed my laptop over and over again messing with settings, digging in the registry and writing simple batch scripts.<br />
I successfully hacked wifi-hotspots with BackTrack and Kali Linux, I've build up a life online in the game and stream community.<br />
I recently setup my own stream. Going through this I've encountered a lot of problems and eventually solved almost all of them.<br />
I've shared solutions with others and so I started helping others out and give advice to those who ask.<br />
For example a lot of streamers are looking for custom build gaming pc's but they're often confused about what to buy or where to buy.<br />
I don't consider myself an expert and I do say so if I'm not sure about something or haven't heard of it. </p>
<p>I expect IT will become a part of our life we can't live without. Based on that we'll need people to create, design, support, secure and maintain it.<br />
Alongside the integration of IT we'll need to introduce new laws and have people to ensure those.<br />
The more IT becomes part of our daily life the more risks come with it and as they say you have to fight fire with fire, I want to become an ethical hacker and hope to attend MIT.  </p>
<p>IT and computers have become a major part of my life, not only for entertainment but for future job chances and social life as well.<br />
It provides me the possibilities and tools for common problem solving and communicating with the world, assists me when playing guitar or the drums and helps me e-shopping and managing my financials.<br />
I still haven't found the girlfriend option though.</p>
